This template repository and Wiki contains everything you need to start a new project.

## About

For instructions on how to use this template, please read the [confluence pages](https://skedulo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3259793829/CX+Project+Template).

The template repository contains the following items:

- [CI/CD configuration](https://skedulo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3259892205/CI+CD+Configuration) using github actions, that runs tests and code quality checks.
- Recommended [configuration and extensions](https://skedulo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3259892264/VS+Code+configuration) for VSCode
- Recommended [file and folder structure](https://skedulo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3258843805/Project+folder+structure)
- [Pre-commit hooks](https://skedulo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3259892254/Pre-commit+hooks) for code formatting

This repository, and subsequent projects are designed to be used with the [Skedulo CLI](https://docs.skedulo.com/developer-guides/cli/skedulo-cli-introduction/) and in conjunction with the pulse solution services [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@skedulo/pulse-solution-services).

When you're ready to start a project, check out the [Getting Started](https://skedulo.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/EN/pages/3259892243/Getting+started+with+the+CX+project+template) page.

## Example

For a working example of this template, including using pulse solution services, please see the [repository here](https://github.com/Skedulo/CXProjectTemplateExample).

The example repository contains a project with several artifact types and that uses many features of the pulse solution services package and can be used as a reference point. For more on the pulse solution services package, see the [documentation](https://skedulo.github.io/pulse-solution-services).
